                        The objective of this article is to predict flight prices given the various parameters. This will be a regression problem since the target or dependent variable is the price (continuous numeric value).Nowadays, the number of people using flight has increased significantly. It is difficult for airlines to maintain prices since price changes dynamically due to different conditions. That's why we will try to use machine learning to solve this problem. This can help airline by predicting what prices they can maintain. It can also help customers to predict future flight rices and plan their journey accordingly.
